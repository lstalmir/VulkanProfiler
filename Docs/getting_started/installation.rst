Installation
============

Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from `GitHub releases page <https://github.com/lstalmir/VulkanProfiler/releases>`_.

Once downloaded or built, the dynamic-link library with the layer must be installed so that the Vulkan loader knows where to look for it. The process is different for Windows and Linux-based systems, and it's described in detail in `Vulkan Layer Interface to the Loader documentation <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/blob/main/docs/LoaderLayerInterface.md>`_.

Windows
-------

On Windows systems the layers are installed in the registry. The profiling layer can be registered in one of the following locations:

- HKLM\\Software\\Khronos\\Vulkan\\ExplicitLayers
- HKCU\\Software\\Khronos\\Vulkan\\ExplicitLayers

The first location includes paths to layer manifest files available for all users of the computer (HKLM - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE). The second one lists layers installed for the currently logged user (HKCU - HKEY_CURRENT_USER).

Once the location has been selected, a new DWORD value must be added, with its name being an absolute path to the layer's JSON manifest (e.g., "C:\\layers\\VkLayer_profiler_layer.json") and its value set to 0.

Linux
-----

The following instructions have been prepared for Debian-based distributions. Locations of Vulkan layers may be different on other distros.

Vulkan layers on Linux are stored in predefined directories. To install the layer, simply copy the .so and .json files from the package to one of those directories.

- $HOME/.local/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
- /usr/local/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
- /usr/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
- /etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
