exercising permissions granted by this License.

&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).

&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<div class="line"><strong>SPIRV-Specification</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Copyright 2014-2025 The Khronos Group Inc.

This Specification is protected by copyright laws and contains material proprietary to Khronos.
Except as described by these terms, it or any components may not be reproduced, republished,
distributed, transmitted, displayed, broadcast or otherwise exploited in any manner without the
express prior written permission of Khronos.

This Specification has been created under the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights
Policy, which is Attachment A of the Khronos Group Membership Agreement available at
www.khronos.org/files/member_agreement.pdf.

Khronos grants a conditional copyright license to use and reproduce the
unmodified Specification for any purpose, without fee or royalty, EXCEPT no licenses
to any patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights are granted under these
terms. Parties desiring to implement the Specification and make use of Khronos trademarks
in relation to that implementation, and receive reciprocal patent license protection under
the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy must become Adopters and confirm the
implementation as conformant under the process defined by Khronos for this Specification;
see https://www.khronos.org/adopters.

Khronos makes no, and expressly disclaims any, representations or warranties,
express or implied, regarding this Specification, including, without limitation:
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of any
intellectual property, correctness, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and
reliability. Under no circumstances will Khronos, or any of its Promoters,
Contributors or Members, or their respective partners, officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives be liable for any damages, whether direct,
indirect, special or consequential damages for lost revenues, lost profits, or
otherwise, arising from or in connection with these materials.

This Specification contains substantially unmodified functionality from, and is a successor
to, Khronos specifications including all versions of &quot;The SPIR Specification&quot;,
&quot;The OpenGL Shading Language&quot;, &quot;The OpenGL ES Shading Language&quot;, as well as all Khronos
OpenCL API and OpenCL programming language specifications.

The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy defines the terms Scope, Compliant Portion,
and Necessary Patent Claims.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and so are EXCLUDED from the Scope
of this Specification. Section 1.3 &quot;About This Document&quot; defines how
these parts of the Specification are identified.

Where this Specification uses technical terminology, defined in the Glossary or otherwise,
that refer to enabling technologies that are not expressly set forth in this Specification,
those enabling technologies are EXCLUDED from the Scope of this Specification. For clarity,
enabling technologies not disclosed with particularity in this Specification
(e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, hardware architecture, processor architecture
or microarchitecture, memory architecture, compiler technology, object oriented technology,
basic operating system technology, compression technology, algorithms, and so on) are NOT
to be considered expressly set forth; only those application program interfaces and data
structures disclosed with particularity are included in the Scope of this Specification.

For purposes of the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy as it relates to the
definition of Necessary Patent Claims, all recommended or optional features, behaviors
and functionality set forth in this Specification, if implemented, are considered to
be included as Compliant Portions.
